The idea of my classmate's work: Young people are more likely to use bikes to commute compared to older people.

His NULL HYPOTHESIS:

The ratio of people aged 21-40 biking on weekdays to people aged 21-40 biking on weekends is 
equal or lower than the ration of people aged 41-60 biking on weekdays to people aged 41-60 biking on weekends.

--------------------------------------

I think his hypothesis is reasonable. 

In order to verify that the data supports the project: 

He has the data both of the usage of different ages groups and also each week days usage data. 

To decide which test to use:

I ask myself three questions:

1. what type of data? 

Based on his hypothesis, it has the independent variable - the two age groups, 
which is the Younger group 21-40,  and the older group 41-60, I would identify them as Categorical variables. 

2. how many samples do i have? 

two samples, older and younger. Also each sample has two variables. 
The age and the days of the week of riding. The ratio is the dependent variable, which is continuous data.

3. what the purpose:

Get the difference of the ratios of two samples sets. 

So I would recommend my classmate to use T - test
