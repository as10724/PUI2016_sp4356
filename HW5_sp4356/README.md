## Assignment 1

Test if the age distribution of citibe riders comes from specific distributions. Use three months of data from 2015.

Apply KS test to test whether the data come from a Gaussian or Gamma distribution. In both cases the null hypothesis that the data come from this particular distribution is rejected.

Apply AD test to test the same hypothesis as above for Gaussian and Exponential distributions. Again, the null hypothesis is rejected.

## Assignment 2

In this analysis I examine whether women are getting paid less than men for the same positions. I organize/manipulate the data and create scatter plots of male v. female median income. 

I fit a regression line to model the data for different races, and a second regression to account for all types of income. Then, I estimate a woman's earnings based on male's salary for the same role. The data show that in fact women get paid less than men for the same position.
