## Assignment 1

In this part, I create 100 samples (with different sizes drawn from population with the same mean=100) of 5 distributions.
I plot the mean of each sample and a histogram of all sample means. The results verify the _Central Limit Theorem_.

## Assignment 2

I work on the CitiBike dataset. I download the data for March 2015 and I want to test the idea that yound people are more likely
to bike for their commute. I plot several statistics regarding frequency of bike checkout by day and age category. 
Lastly I plot the fraction of normalized rides per age group for weekdays and weekends.

## Assignment 3

I formulate the null hypothesis that the commute time with the new bus route is equal or less on average compared to the old one. 
Download the data and perform z-test. Z-test rejects the null hypothesis.
